# Mozilla IRCCloud
Recipe for Mozilla's IRCCloud integration with Franz 5 .

Also has a host of customisations that I use:
- removes user-mode dot/pill
- removes background colour from your own messages
- render users in italic in the channel selector
- adds a little more space between the author and the message text
- reduces the size of pastebins
- removes irc colours
- removes comic sans
- makes channel notices not look like messages where you are mentioned
